    ">In today's dynamic entertainment landscape, the demand for original video content is skyrocketing, with major companies establishing their own movie studios to captivate audiences. Inspired by this trend, Microsoft has embarked on a mission to venture into the realm of filmmaking by creating its own movie studio. However, given their limited knowledge and experience in the domain, Microsoft is confronted with a crucial challenge: Determining the types of films that are currently enjoying significant success at the box office. This is where data analysis and exploration come into play.\n",

By delving into the realm of cinema, I will uncover valuable insights that can inform the head of Microsoft's new movie studio in making informed decisions about the types of films to produce. This project aims to leverage the power of data to provide actionable recommendations that will guide Microsoft in creating compelling content, tailored to capture the hearts and minds of moviegoers, and position the company as a major player in the ever-evolving world of film production."
