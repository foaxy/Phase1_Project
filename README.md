Key Business Questions:

    What types of films are currently performing the best at the box office?
    How can Microsoft leverage this information to make strategic decisions about film production?
    What recommendations can be made to help Microsoft's movie studio thrive?

## Data Understanding and Analysis

The data being used is from `im.db` database. The database has 8 tables:

>>- movie_basics
>>- directors
>>- known_for
>>- movie_akas
>>- movie_ratings
>>- persons
>>- principals
>>- writers

The `movie_ratings` and `movie_basics` tables will be used in the analysis. `movie_ratings` provides information on movie ratings while `movie_basics` table provides information on various movie attributes such as start_year, runtime and genre.

## Conclusion

    Action, Comedy and Documentary genres tend to perform exceptionally well at the box office, generating the highest average revenue. Microsoft's movie studio should consider producing films in these genres to maximize their chances of success.

    The average box office gross has shown an upward trend over the years, indicating a growing market. Microsoft should capitalize on this trend by investing in high-quality productions that align with audience preferences.

    While high production budgets can result in higher box office gross, it is important to strike a balance between investment and potential returns. Microsoft should carefully evaluate the production budgets of different genres and consider cost-effective strategies without compromising the overall quality of the films.
